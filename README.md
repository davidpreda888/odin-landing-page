# Odin Landing Page

This is the final project of The Odin Project's "Flexbox" portion of the foundations
course. I chose to make a comical page about my friends to test myself with everything
I've learned up until now. I also chose to incorporate somethings not seen in the
course like hover animations since I thought it could add a special interactive touch
to the page.
